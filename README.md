# Just-Drive
"No text, tweet, Facebook update, or email is worth your life. Put the phone down and Just Drive"

#Description
Texting while driving is now the leading cause of death among teenagers suprisingly surpassing driving while intoxicated, according to a study by Cohen Children’s Medical Center. Disturbing statistics from the report includes 3,000 and more teens die each year in crashes caused by texting while driving, more than 50 percent of teens admit to texting while driving, 95 percent read texts and emails when alone – 32 percent do so when with friends or parents, More than 90 percent admitted to posting on social media sites while behind the wheel – but only 29 percent when with others.

**Just Drive** aims to lessen or even stop vehicle accidents cause by activities such as texting, calling, and other distractions while driving.

#####How does it work?
Using the newest Activity Recognition API by Google, Just Drive detects your activity if you're in a vehicle or not while maintaining low battery consumption on your device in the long run, it will displays a lockscreen to prevent device usage without compromising basic function of your device. The lockscreen will be deactivated automatically and/or through an on-screen test to prove that you are not driving. Although there will be a HeadsUp notification that will prompt and will ask if you are a passenger or a driver before activating the lockscreen. This app also turns your notification volume to silent (unless you're using wired or bluetooth headset), Send an automated text to those who are trying to reach you via a phone call or text messaging while you are driving, and Just Drive also uses Text-to-Speech to read incoming contact or number of incoming phone calling.
