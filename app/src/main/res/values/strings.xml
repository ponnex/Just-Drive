    <string name="about_body">Just Drive aims for lesser vehicle accidents by preventing texting, use, and distractions to those that are driving. Using the newest ActivityRecognitionAPI
        (com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:7.0.0) by Google to detect your activity if you\'re in a vehicle or not, it then display a lockscreen that will only be deactivated when Just Drive will
        detect that you are not driving. Although there will be a HeadsUp notification that will prompt you if you are a passenger or a driver before activating the lockscreen. This app also turn your
        notification volume off (unless you\'re using wired or bluetooth headset), Send an automated text to those who are trying to reach you while driving, and use Text-to-Speech API to read incoming
        contact or number of those that are calling. You can even customize your own Auto reply Message! </string>
